# Bering_Sea_Plankton_Sequencing


This repository contains the code for filtering, processing and analyzing shotgun and diatom amplicon sequencing data from a marine sediment core from the Bering Sea for the manuscript: Buchwald, S. Z., Herzschuh, U., NÃ¼rnberg, D., Harms, L., & Stoof-Leichsenring, K. R. Plankton community changes during the last 124 000 years in the subarctic Bering Sea derived from sedimentary ancient DNA. <br>
It contains all necessary files and scripts for reproducing the results presented in the manuscript.

Raw DNA shotgun data (Bioproject number PRJE866300) and raw DNA amplicon-sequencing data (Bioproject number PRJEB66201) have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). The `scripts` and `input_files` from the two folders `Shotgun`and `Diatom_Amplicon_Sequencing`can be used to reanalyze the data, they also contain a more detailed description of the data provided and the used codes.
