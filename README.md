# Bering_Sea_Plankton_Sequencing


This repository contains the code for filtering, processing and analyzing shotgun and diatom amplicon sequencing data from a marine sediment core from the Bering Sea for the manuscript: Plankton community change during the last 124 000 years in the subarctic Bering Sea derived from sedimentary ancient DNA (add link after publication)
It contains all necessary files and scripts for reproducing the results presented in the manuscript.

For the manuscript, both amplicon sequencing and shotgun sequencing were carried out. To analyze the raw sequencing data stored in bioproject XXX (add bioproject number when upload), the `scripts` and `input_files` from the two folders `Shotgun`and `Diatom_Amplicon_Sequencing`can be used. These folders also contain a more detailed description of the code and data provided and how to run the scripts.
